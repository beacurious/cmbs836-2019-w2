# Challenge (optional)
#
# Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character, 
# numeric, integer, and logical. 
#
# But what happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?
#
# eg:
#
# thing <- c("some characters", 3.141, 100, TRUE)

# What will happen in each of these examples? 
#
# (hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects):
#   
#   num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
#
# Why do you think it happens?

# How many values in combined_logical are "TRUE" (as a character)
# in the following example:
#   
#   num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
#   char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
#   combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
